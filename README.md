Vehicle Registration System

The system provides distinct features for System Administrators and Users:

System Administration Services:

Manage new vehicle registrations and approve or reject user-submitted requests.
Update and validate vehicle registration details in the database.
Access and oversee all registered vehicles, ensuring compliance with regulations.
User Services:

Register new vehicles with the required details.
View and update existing registration records.
Search for vehicle details by registration number.
Check license status and validity.
Retrieve essential documents like PUC (Pollution Under Control), vehicle registration details, and insurance information.



I used the following technologies to build the project:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-End: Node.js for server-side logic and API development
Database: MongoDB for storing and managing vehicle registration records
The chosen stack provided scalability and efficiency for managing dynamic and document-based data.
